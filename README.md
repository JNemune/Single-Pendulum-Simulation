# **ðŸ“Œ Mechanical Vibrations â€“ Single Pendulum Simulation**  

## **ðŸ“„ Project Overview**  
This project focuses on the **simulation of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) pendulum** in **ADAMS** as part of a **Mechanical Vibrations** course. The objective was to analyze the **pendulumâ€™s response to base excitation**, observe its motion, and validate its behavior using simulation tools.  

## **ðŸ›  Requirements**  
To view and run the project, you need:  
- **ADAMS software** (for simulation playback)  
- **A media player** (to watch `MODEL_1.mp4`)  

## **ðŸš€ How to Use**  
1. Open **Main.bin** in **ADAMS** to explore the pendulum simulation.  
2. Watch **MODEL_1.mp4** for a visual representation of the systemâ€™s response.  
3. Refer to the **report (`Mechanical Vibrations Project.pdf`)** for details on system design, analysis, and results.  
4. View **pendulum_angle_yAxis.jpg** and **table_displacement_xAxis.jpg** for key motion data.  

## **ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements**  
- Extend the simulation to a **double pendulum** for increased complexity.  
- Compare results with **analytical solutions** for validation.  
- Implement **damping and external forces** to analyze real-world behavior.
